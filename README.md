# TUIDoList
## Introduction

**TUIDoList** is a simple, easy to use, and fast terminal based to do list written in Rust.

This project served as my first Rust project and was largely based on [this]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTbxXpyqpQ0") YouTube video by Jonkero.

## Installation
### Dependencies
- [Rust and cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) as the build dependencies

### Build
```
cd /path/to/repo
cargo build --release
```

### Run
```
cd /path/to/repo/target/release
./tuidolist
```
or
```
cd /path/to/repo
cargo run --release
```
to build and run at the same time. The final compiled binary will still be located at `/path/to/repo/target/release`.
